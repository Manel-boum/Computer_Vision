üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision Projects


Welcome to the Computer Vision repository! This collection showcases a series of projects and experiments centered around computer vision, utilizing popular libraries such as OpenCV and Python. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of image and video processing, offering hands-on experience with various techniques and algorithms.

üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

face_detection/: Implements real-time face detection using Haar cascades and OpenCV.

image_segmentation/: Demonstrates segmentation techniques to partition images into meaningful segments.

object_tracking/: Explores methods to track objects across video frames.

edge_detection/: Applies algorithms like Canny edge detection to identify edges within images.

license_plate_recognition/: Recognizes and reads license plates from vehicle images.

README.md: Provides an overview and guidance on using the repository.

Note: Each directory contains its own README.md with detailed information about the specific project.
